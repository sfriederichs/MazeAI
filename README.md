This code is part of a science fair project I worked on in 1999. My goal was
to develop an 'artificial intelligence' that could find a path through a 
maze. The behavior of the AI was determined by serveral attributes which 
could take on varying values. Different values in each of the attributes
caused different behavior in the AI, and the combinations of these different
values would alter the AIs behavior even further. 

I wanted to find the combination of attributes that would enable the AI to 
navigate its way through the maze the quickest. I built a wrapper around the
AI code and tested every possible combination of attributes, then collected
the results.

I *believe* my final conclusion was that the AI that randomly decided 
between turning left or right when it ran into a wall was the fastest. 

*Sigh* All that work for a trivial result. Oh well!

Out of a sense of nostalgia, a desire to publically humiliate myself by 
publishing 20 year old code, and a need to back up my data, I've decided to
put it up here on Github. I've first posted the 'raw' working directory just 
as I left it last time I worked on it. I'll slowly clean it up, write some
makefiles, document the code, etc. Given the sense of nostalgia, I'm going
to try not to change too much of the actual code. 

I really should. It's awfully embarassing. But I won't.
